# Alpaca CLI

Manage your Alpaca portfolio from the comfort of your terminal!

Good when you want to trade inconspicuously (at work, at school, on a date),
or if you're just a nerd like me.

## Warning

and for using this software responsibly.
Make sure that you know what a command will do before you run it.

and is distributed in the hope that others might find it interesting.
